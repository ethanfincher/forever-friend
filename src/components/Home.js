				Forever friends is (currently) a front end integration with an API

				ability to find a new forever friend by searching with your zip code,
				and finding tons of pets by you, as well as in depth details about each
				pet, and a way to get in contact with the person or shelter currently in
				possession of your future friend. So, go ahead and start searching!
